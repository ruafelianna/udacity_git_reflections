How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

One line had minus at the beginning, other one - plus.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Quick rollback to versions. Making forks.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Good logical reason to do it manually. But it's nice when it's done automatically, so the user cannot forget about it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Different purposes of version control.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Log shows the history of commits. Diff compares two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always check previoous versions, you can see what might have caused the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Don't know yet :3
