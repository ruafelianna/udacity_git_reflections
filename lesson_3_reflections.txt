When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I wanna share with other ppl, or when I have several PCs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because several local repositories can have access to one remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is the full copy of repository. A fork is a special feature of GitHub which makes a copy of repository on GitHub and gives a link back to fork. Branch is a named sequence of commits where all the commits can be got as the parents of commits starting with the last one.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We have up-to-date info.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

We'd need to go to the library and compare the files we changed manually haha :D

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

We wanna keep master branch as a "production" version, so if we are making any changes we better make a different branch and then merge it with master branch when we are sure it's ok.
